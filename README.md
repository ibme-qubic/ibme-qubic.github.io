Quantitative Biomedical Inference group at the University of Oxford
Institute of Biomedical Engineering. The QuBIc group applies inference 
(estimation) techniques from information engineering to biomedical data, 
primarily with a view to clinical application.

## Projects and Documentation

### Fabber

Fabber is a Bayesian model fitting framework which uses the Variational Bayes
algorithm to do fast model fitting of nonlinear forward models.

 - [Fabber core](https://fabber-core.readthedocs.io) defines the main model fitting algorithm
   and contains a few simple generic models for testing and demonstration purposes.
 - [Fabber DCE models](https://fabber-dce.readthedocs.io) is a set of Fabber models for
   DCE-MRI data
